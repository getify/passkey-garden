			<p>
				Technology always claims it's able to solve our security issues.
				But in the end, the weakest link is always the human, because:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					we can all too easily be tricked (aka,
					<a href="https://www.phishing.org/what-is-phishing"
					target="_blank" rel="noopener">phished!</a>), by sophisticated
					scammers that make a site that looks <em>just like</em> our
					bank, AND construct a very plausible looking domain/URL that
					convinces you <em>it must be</em> your bank. And then there's
					the social engineering of them calling you on the phone and
					pretending to be customer support, and sending you an SMS code
					you need to share with them, and... blah blah. It's a never-ending
					string of <strong>social engineering</strong> hacks so they
					don't even have to steal our secrets, we just willingly give
					them over, because... we're sheep.
				</li>
				<li>
					we are lazy, and unsophisticated, and annoyed by password
					fatigue, so we just come up with <em>one good password</em> (or
					maybe even a not so good), and we reuse it over and over again.
				</li>
				<li>
					we choose convenience over security, <strong>every single
					time</strong>. we only "pick" security when there's no choice
					and it's forced on us.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				So, why on earth are passkeys going to be any different? This is
				just another vendor lock-in hype cycle, right?!?
			</p>
			<p>
				Nope, passkeys really are the solution to all this mess. They
				really are the future. They really are <strong>phishing
				proof</strong>. But how? Two key things you need to know about
				passkeys that you probably didn't realize:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						Even if a scammer tricks you into believing you should give
						away your account credentials secrets to them, it's
						<strong>truly impossible</strong> for you to do so. Even if
						you <em>really want to give them</em> the secrets, you can't.
					</p>
					<p>
						Passkeys hide the actual secret in a very secure place on
						your device, that even YOU can't get into (nor can the
						police or anyone else!). It's a secure system where the
						secret goes in once, and NEVER comes out. It's a
						<strong>security black box</strong>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Passkeys shift the security/trust mechanism from the server
						to the client. The server doesn't need your secret to let
						you into your account. It only needs to know for sure that
						you can still <em>use</em> (but not share!) your secret.
					</p>
					<p>
						The server asks a question (a <em>challenge</em>), and the
						client asks the user to prove who they are with biometrics (Face, Fingerprint, etc). Once the biometric factor is
						provided, the question/challenge is sent into the black box,
						and your secret is <em>used</em> to create an answer (a
						<em>signature</em>) that only your secret could provide,
						using special math called "public-key cryptography". No,
						that's <strong>NOT</strong> the "cryptocurrency" (bitcoin,
						etc) you've heard of!
					</p>
					<p>
						That answer/signature is sent back to the server, which
						matches it up to the question/challenge it asked. When they
						match, you're let into your account. Boom, that's it!
					</p>
					<p>
						And the important part is, that answer/signature is of no
						use to anyone except the actual server that asked the
						question. Even if a scammer/hacker got ahold of an
						answer/signature, they can't reuse it later, and they
						can't use it anywhere else. It's one-time and locked to
						only where the question/challenge came from. They can't
						generate any new answers/signatures from it, because the
						math is one-way (can't be reversed).
					</p>
					<p>
						Again, put simply: the scammer/hacker can't get your actual
						secret because even you don't have access to your secret
						to give it to them. Your secret is hidden, and can only be
						<em>used</em> by your device, if your biometric factor
						matches. <strong>This is about as secure as it gets.</strong>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Now, the second piece of the puzzle. You create this secret
						and store it securely on your device. But what if you get
						tricked into trying to use this secret by a "man in the
						middle" attack, where another server shows you a site
						that <em>looks exactly</em> like the site you want to login
						to? Can't they then piggyback off your legitimate session
						and do nefarious things in the background while you do your
						legitimate stuff?
					</p>
					<p>
						Again, nope! You're safe. The passkey secret you create is
						absolutely locked to the same origin (domain name, port,
						protocol, etc), and can <em>never be used</em> for any other
						origin, no matter how much it might <em>look like</em> the
						same.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>No matter how tricked you as a human may be</strong>,
						your browser/device will never let you use your passkey on a
						different site than you initially registered with. Period.
						Unlike passwords, passkeys are locked to origins, so a
						scammer/hacker cannot come along and sneak in between later.
					</p>
					<p>
						Oh, but... what about the scammer/hacker that tricks you
						from the <em>very beginning</em>? If they are the middle man
						all along, they have you completely compromised, right?
					</p>
					<p>
						Again, nope. When a server is registering the passkey the
						first time, the origin used when the client prompts the
						user for their passkey registration, is *locked* into the
						passkey, and will be locked into every answer/signature the
						client ever gives back to the server.
					</p>
					<p>
						In short, the <em>server can always tell</em> if an attacker
						is in the middle, and reject, even from the very first
						time you sign up. Your bank would never allow such an
						attack to proceed.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				In short, passkeys are full protection for your account security,
				<strong>even if you yourself don't act very secure!</strong>
			</p>

		<details id="passkey-sync">
			<summary>Do I have to re-setup passkeys on each device!?
				<a class="more-anchor-link" href="#passkey-sync"
					aria-role="presentation"
					aria-label="add this anchor link as address bar's URL fragment"
				>ðŸ”—</a>
			</summary>

			<p>
				When you register an account using a traditional password, you
				can usually login to that account immediately, from any device,
				as long as you remember and enter that password. That's a desired
				and expected convenience!
			</p>
			<p>
				So how does this work in the world of passkeys, since they seem to
				be more locked to each specific device?
			</p>
			<p>
				At its core, passkeys shift the burden of ensuring user identity
				and authentication from the server (checking a password) to the
				client device (prompting the user for their biometric factor). For
				security reasons, <em>that does mean</em> that inherently,
				<strong>passkeys are per-device</strong>.
			</p>
			<p>
				If someday you have 50 different online accounts setup with passkeys,
				and you want to access all those accounts from each of your three
				devices (phone, tablet, laptop), <strong>YES, you will have to
				setup all 50 account passkeys on each device</strong>, meaning you'll
				have 150 unique passkeys.
			</p>
			<p>
				That <em>might not sit well</em> with you. Think about the extra
				effort it will require on your part. You might immediately recoil
				in dislike of that prospect.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now, reality check: passkey setup is generally one or two clicks,
				plus showing your face or fingerprint. It's really not much, and
				only takes a few seconds. It's usually <em>far quicker</em> than
				traditional password-based account setup.
			</p>
			<p>
				That said, most people will not be enthusiastic about this situation.
			</p>
			<p>
				Per-device passkeys are the new gold standard for account security,
				but there's no question that it will be a bit less convenient. That
				friction is a <em>necessary difficulty</em>. But as pointed out
				above, when given the choice between convenience and security, most
				everyone chooses convenience, most every time.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>So what do we do?</strong> Swear off passkeys and go back to
				passwords?!?
			</p>
			<p>
				Google and Apple both know this reality, accutely. Since these two
				companies control the vast majority of devices (especially mobile),
				and indeed the two largest software ecosystems in the world, they're
				both in a position to meaningfully strike a balance between security
				and convenience. So they've each responded with a <em>compromise</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Google (via Android, and the Chrome browser) provides the
				<a href="https://passwords.google.com/?pli=1" target="_blank"
				rel="noopener">Google Password Manager</a>. You've likely already
				used it to store your passwords, credit cards, and other personal info, all conveniently cloud-synchronized to all your devices.
			</p>
			<p>
				And Apple's <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/109016"
				target="_blank" rel="noopener">iCloud Keychain</a> does the same thing
				for all your iOS devices.
			</p>
			<p>
				Both of these mechanisms now support setting up and synchronizing
				passkeys across your devices, in much the same way.
			</p>
			<p>
				Honestly, that's fantastic news! The security of passkeys, with the
				convenience of automatic cross-device synchronization. Win-win!
			</p>
			<p>
				Of course, it <em>is a compromise</em>. Such passkeys are able to
				be synchronized cross-device because they aren't actually stored
				in the securest parts of your device/OS, as per-device passkeys are.
				These synchronized passkeys basically use Google's or Apple's
				servers as the "secure device authenticator".
			</p>
			<p>
				Google and Apple both say that they store this secret information
				in a secure way. They don't actually store any of your biometrics
				on their servers. They use your biometrics locally on your device,
				to encrypt your secret, and then store that encrypted information
				both on your device and on their servers.
			</p>
			<p>
				So to be clear: <strong>ONLY YOU can only "unlock" and use that
				secret info</strong>, if you present your biometric factor
				<strong>on your device.</strong> They can't do anything with your
				encrypted secrets without your intervention. They're only
				<em>holding</em> the encrypted information for you -- a concept
				known as
				<a href="https://nordlocker.com/features/zero-knowledge-encryption/"
				target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zero-Knowledge Encryption</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				But yeah, they're storing <em>some</em> information, like what site
				and username/email you used to setup each passkey. Is that "tracking"
				you? <strong>Yes.</strong> More so than if you used a per-device
				passkey without any cloud synchronization.
			</p>
			<p>
				And, a lesser but not unimportant concern is, you cannot use these
				passkeys locally on your device without a connection to the
				respective cloud service (Google or Apple). If those were ever down,
				or you were locked out for some reason, your access to your own
				passkeys (for all your other accounts) is blocked.
			</p>
			<p>
				You should think very carefully about how you feel about this
				compromise. There's no "free lunch" here. Your account security
				is important, and passwords are no longer a sufficient and durable
				system for protection. Passkeys are the better solution. But with
				that extra security, there's a choice to be made: are we going to
				take our own responsibility (and effort), or are we going to choose
				the convenience and offload that to Google or Apple?
			</p>
			<p>
				We can't make that choice for you. That's up to you. But at least
				you're more well-informed now, so your choice will be be more
				responsible and appropriate.

			<p>
				As mentioned <a href="#passkey-sync">in the previous question</a>,
				passkeys <em>can be synced</em> through Google Password Manager and
				Apple's iCloud Keychain. But what about exchanging my passkeys across
				these ecosystems? And what about using other password managers?
			</p>
			<p>
				This is an emerging field, so information is subject to change. But,
				the good news is, the main players in this space are indeed working
				on this capability. In particular, the FIDO alliance is working
				<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specifications-credential-exchange-specifications/" target="_blank"
				rel="noopener">on a set of specifications for credential exchange</a>,
				where you will have more portability and interoperability of your
				passkey synchronization.
			</p>
			<p>
				If this is an area you're specifically interested in, you might
				consider <a href="https://github.com/fido-alliance/credential-exchange-feedback" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting
				involved by providing feedback</a> on those draft specifications.
			</p>
			<p>
				Popular third-party password managers, such as Bitwarden, 1Password,
				and Dashlane, are all actively engaged in adding passkey support,
				and including passkey synchronization and exchange capabilities. Of
				course, the same concerns shared in the previous section, about the
				tradeoffs of the security/convenience compromise, apply. Think
				carefully about this choice.

				Eh, kinda, but not really. The
				<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/get-the-passkey-icon/"
				target="_blank" rel="noopener">FIDO Alliance</a> has an icon they
				claim to be official for passkeys, and indeed it's used (and

				align="center"
				alt="Apple's interpretation of the FIDO passkey icon"
				title="Apple's FIDO Icon"></a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, FIDO's icon is trademarked, and has some fairly strong
				guidelines/requirements for its usage. As far as we're concerned,
				that's not best for widespread adoption.
			</p>
			<p>
				Also, we feel design-wise that icon is lacking -- it <em>reads</em>
				as "my body is the key" -- and that doesn't promote the ideal
				balance of clarity and trust, especially for non-technical folks.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ideally, a good icon for this purpose will fit people's typical
				mental model of what's happening. When non-technical folks are asked
				about unlocking their device with their face or finger, they don't
				typically think something like, "my body's unique biologic
				characteristics are the key that unlocks the device". Yes, that's
				<em>literally</em> what's happening, but it's not how people think
				about it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Instead, they tend to think of it more like, "my device recognized me
				and unlocked". The <strong>"device recognized me"</strong> semantic
				is a much stronger design inspiration than <strong>"my body is the
				key"</strong>.
			</p>
			<p>
				We should lean in that direction when designing a universal icon
				for passkeys, since we want everyone to <em>feel more naturally
				trusting</em> of the mechanism.

			<p>
				There's already been quite a few ideas on icons for this purpose.
				We're grateful for all ideas, but not all ideas are suitable for
				the goals here.
			</p>
			<p>
				Why not an icon with ONLY a fingerprint? Because <strong>a
				lot</strong> of users have newer iOS devices that only use Face
				ID, and many have never used their fingerprint to unlock their
				device! Similarly, many Windows users have only ever used
				Windows Hello (e.g., Face ID). But by contrast, millions of
				Android users have only ever unlocked their devices with their
				fingerprint (aka Touch ID).
			</p>
			<p>
				Further, it seems a commonly held impression of many (especially
				younger) iOS users, that "fingerprint" unlock is only on "older"
				iOS devices, since Apple used to have TouchID and later
				switched exclusively to FaceID. We should be wary of leaning on
				an icon design that evokes this <em>negative ("older")</em>
				emotion.
			<p>
				The point? <strong>We need an icon that NEITHER assumes <em>only</em>
				fingerprint or face.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				FIDO notably skips both in their icon -- instead using a generic
				key and a head/shoulders profile -- but... we think we can do better.
			</p>
			<p>
				Also, <em>clever</em> ideas, such as an oval with one half side
				as a fingerprint and the other half side as a face, seem really good
				conceptually, but in execution lack legibility or recognizability
				when the icon is rendered small (under 30px square).
			</p>
			<p>
				Icon design is a really tricky skill & art. It's much harder than
				logo design!
			</p>
			<p>
				If you have ideas you think will execute better on the goals and
				vision here, please let us know! Preview your icon by
