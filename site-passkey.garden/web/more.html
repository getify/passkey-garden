				You can think of this site as a living style-guide for passkeys.
			</p>
			<p>
				The icons (A, B, etc) shown are <em>candidates</em> for a single
				unified icon to represent <strong>passkey</strong> account
				registration and login. We, the community, should decide what icon
				we want to standardize on. Your input is welcomed!
			</p>
			<p>
				The ideal icon will <em>feel</em> universal, render well in various
				sizes and color schemes, promote security/trust, and adequately
				communicate to all (even non-technical folks), whether they've used
				Face ID, Touch ID, or other similar biometric factors to unlock their
				devices.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Why "Garden"?</strong> Put simply, the style customization
				experience here is inspired by

				Technology is always trying to claim it's able to solve our
				problems. But in the end, the weakest link is always the
				human, because:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					we can all too easily be tricked (aka,
					<a href="https://www.phishing.org/what-is-phishing"
					target="_blank" rel="noopener">phished!</a>), by sophisticated
					scammers that make a site that looks <em>just like</em> our
					bank, AND construct a very plausible looking domain/URL that
					convinces you <em>it must be</em> your bank. And then there's
					the social engineering of them calling you on the phone and
					pretending to be customer support, and sending you an SMS code
					you need to share with them, and... blah blah. It's a never-ending
					string of <strong>social engineering</strong> hacks so they
					don't even have to steal our secrets, we just willingly give
					them over, because... we're sheep.
				</li>
				<li>
					we are lazy, and unsophisticated, and annoyed by password
					fatigue, so we just come up with <em>one good password</em> (or
					maybe even a not so good), and we reuse it over and over again.
				</li>
				<li>
					we choose convenience over security, <strong>every single
					time</strong>. we only "pick" security when there's no choice
					and it's forced on us.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				So, why on earth are passkeys going to be any different? This is
				just another vendor lock-in hype cycle, right?!?
			</p>
			<p>
				Nope, passkeys really are the solution to all this mess. They
				really are the future. They really are <strong>phishing
				proof</strong>. But how? Two key things you need to know about
				passkeys that you probably didn't realize:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						Even if a scammer tricks you into believing you should give
						away your account credentials secrets to them, it's
						<strong>truly impossible</strong> for you to do so. Even if
						you <em>really want to give them</em> the secrets, you can't.
					</p>
					<p>
						Passkeys hide the actual secret in a very secure place on
						your device, that even YOU can't get into (nor can the
						police or anyone else!). It's a secure system where the
						secret goes in once, and NEVER comes out. It's a
						<strong>security black box</strong>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Passkeys shift the security/trust mechanism from the server
						to the client. The server doesn't need your secret to let
						you into your account. It only needs to know for sure that
						you can still <em>use</em> (but not share!) your secret.
					</p>
					<p>
						The server asks a question (a <em>challenge</em>), and the
						client asks the user to prove who they are with biometrics (Face, Fingerprint, etc). Once the biometric factor is
						provided, the question/challenge is sent into the black box,
						and your secret is <em>used</em> to create an answer (a
						<em>signature</em>) that only your secret could provide,
						using special math called "public-key cryptography". No,
						that's <strong>NOT</strong> the "cryptocurrency" (bitcoin,
						etc) you've heard of!
					</p>
					<p>
						That answer/signature is sent back to the server, which
						matches it up to the question/challenge it asked. When they
						match, you're let into your account. Boom, that's it!
					</p>
					<p>
						And the important part is, that answer/signature is of no
						use to anyone except the actual server that asked the
						question. Even if a scammer/hacker got ahold of an
						answer/signature, they can't reuse it later, and they
						can't use it anywhere else. It's one-time and locked to
						only where the question/challenge came from. They can't
						generate any new answers/signatures from it, because the
						math is one-way (can't be reversed).
					</p>
					<p>
						Again, put simply: the scammer/hacker can't get your actual
						secret because even you don't have access to your secret
						to give it to them. Your secret is hidden, and can only be
						<em>used</em> by your device, if your biometric factor
						matches. <strong>This is about as secure as it gets.</strong>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Now, the second piece of the puzzle. You create this secret
						and store it securely on your device. But what if you get
						tricked into trying to use this secret by a "man in the
						middle" attack, where another server shows you a site
						that <em>looks exactly</em> like the site you want to login
						to? Can't they then piggyback off your legitimate session
						and do nefarious things in the background while you do your
						legitimate stuff?
					</p>
					<p>
						Again, nope! You're safe. The passkey secret you create is
						absolutely locked to the same origin (domain name, port,
						protocol, etc), and can <em>never be used</em> for any other
						origin, no matter how much it might <em>look like</em> the
						same.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>No matter how tricked you as a human may be</strong>,
						your browser/device will never let you use your passkey on a
						different site than you initially registered with. Period.
						Unlike passwords, passkeys are locked to origins, so a
						scammer/hacker cannot come along and sneak in between later.
					</p>
					<p>
						Oh, but... what about the scammer/hacker that tricks you
						from the <em>very beginning</em>? If they are the middle man
						all along, they have you completely compromised, right?
					</p>
					<p>
						Again, nope. When a server is registering the passkey the
						first time, the origin used when the client prompts the
						user for their passkey registration, is *locked* into the
						passkey, and will be locked into every answer/signature the
						client ever gives back to the server.
					</p>
					<p>
						In short, the <em>server can always tell</em> if an attacker
						is in the middle, and reject, even from the very first
						time you sign up. Your bank would never allow such an
						attack to proceed.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				In short, passkeys are full protection for your account security,
				<strong>even if you yourself don't act very secure!</strong>

				Eh, kinda, but not really. The
				<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/get-the-passkey-icon/"
				target="_blank" rel="noopener">FIDO Alliance</a> has an icon they
				claim to be official for passkeys, and indeed it's used (and
				remixed/re-interpreted) in

				align="center"
				alt="Apple's interpretation of the FIDO passkey icon"
				title="Apple's FIDO Icon"></a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, FIDO's icon is trademarked, and has some fairly strong
				guidelines/requirements for its usage. As far as we're concerned,
				that's not best for widespread adoption.
			</p>
			<p>
				Also, we feel design-wise that icon is lacking -- it <em>reads</em>
				as "my body is the key" -- and that doesn't promote the ideal
				balance of clarity and trust, especially for non-technical folks.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ideally, a good icon for this purpose will fit people's typical
				mental model of what's happening. When non-technical folks are asked
				about unlocking their device with their face or finger, they don't
				typically say something like, "my body's biometric uniqueness was
				the key that unlocked the device". That's <em>literally</em> what's
				happening, but not how people think about it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Instead, they tend to think of it more like, "my device recognized me and unlocked". This "device recognized me" semantic is a much
				stronger design inspiration than "my body is the key".

			<summary>Why not ___ for an icon?
				<a class="more-anchor-link" href="#why-not-icon"

			</summary>

			<p>
				There's already been quite a few ideas on icons for this purpose.
				We're grateful for all ideas, but not all ideas are suitable for
				the goals here.
			</p>
			<p>
				Why not an icon with only a fingerprint? Because <strong>a
				lot</strong> of users have newer iOS devices that only use Face
				ID, and many have never used their fingerprint to unlock their
				device! Similarly, many Windows users have only ever used
				Windows Hello (Face ID). But millions of Android users have
				only ever unlocked their devices with their fingerprint (Touch ID).
			</p>
			<p>
				The point? We need an icon that doesn't assume fingerprint or face.
				FIDO skips both in their icon, but... we think we can do better.
			</p>
			<p>
				Also, many <em>clever</em> ideas, such as an oval with one half side
				as a fingerprint and the other half side as a face, seem really good
				conceptually, but in execution do not have any legibility or
				recognizability when the icon is rendered small (under 30px square).
			</p>
			<p>
				Icon design is a really tricky skill & art. It's even harder than
				logo design!
			</p>
			<p>
				If you have ideas that you think will execute better on the goals
				and vision here, please let us know! Try out your icon by
				<a href="/">uploading in the garden</a> on this site, and
				<a href="https://github.com/getify/passkey-garden/discussions/1"

				what it looks like. Your icon might just be chosen by the community
				as the preferred standard!
