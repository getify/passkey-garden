			<summary>What is this garden?</summary>
			<p>
				This tool is a simple playground to explore possible improved
				branding/UX around
				<a href="https://www.passkeys.com/what-are-passkeys" target="_blank">
				biometric passkey (FaceID, TouchID, etc)</a> authentication for web
				sites/apps.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can think of this site a living style-guide for passkeys.
			</p>
			<p>
				The icons (A, B, etc) shown are <em>candidates</em> for a single
				unified icon to represent <strong>passkey</strong> account
				registration and login. We, the community, should decide what icon
				we want to standardize on. Your input is welcomed!
			</p>
			<p>
				The ideal icon will <em>feel</em> universal, render well in various
				sizes and color schemes, promote security/trust, and adequately
				communicate (even to non-technical folks) to all, whether they use
				Face ID, Touch ID, or other similar biometric factors to unlock their
				devices.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Why "Garden"?</strong> Put simply, the style customization
				experience here is inspired by
				<a href="https://csszengarden.com/" target="_blank">the design
				customization of CSS Zen Garden</a>.

				<a href="https://www.passkeys.com/what-are-passkeys" target="_blank">
				Passkeys</a> are the next-generation standard for logging
				in -- no passwords, no hassle.
			</p>
			<p>
				Just like you unlock your device with your face or
				fingerprint, passkeys let you do the same to log
				into websites and apps -- same security and trust,
				just expanded to more places.
			</p>
			<ul class="list-custom-bullets">
				<li class="secure-lock">
					Stronger security – Passkeys can't be stolen, guessed, or
					phished.
				</li>
				<li class="lightning-bolt">
					Faster login – A single click + your fingerprint or face =
					instant access.
				</li>
				<li class="person-arms-x">
					No more passwords – No typing, no remembering, no frustration.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Big players like Apple, Google, and Microsoft are already
				backing passkeys as the future of login security. You've
				probably already used them without realizing it!

			<summary>Isn't there already an "official" icon for passkeys?</summary>

			<p>
				Eh, kinda, but not really. The
				<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/get-the-passkey-icon/"
				target="_blank">FIDO Alliance</a> has an icon they claim to be
				official for passkeys, and indeed it's used (and
				remixed/re-interpreted) in
				<a href="https://www.streamlinehq.com/icons/download/passkey--30000"
				target="_blank">various
				<img src="/images/streamline-fido-icon.svg" width="30" height="30"
				align="center"
				alt="Streamline's interpretation of the FIDO passkey icon"
				title="Streamline's FIDO Icon"></a>
				<a href="https://developer.apple.com/assets/elements/icons/passkeys/passkeys-96x96_2x.png"

				<img src="/images/apple-passkeys-96x96_2x.png" width="30" height="30"
				align="center"
				alt="Apple's interpretation of the FIDO passkey icon"
				title="Apple's FIDO Icon"></a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, FIDO's icon is trademarked, and has some fairly strong
				guidelines/requirements for its usage. As far as we're concerned,
				that's not really suitable for widespread adoption, so it's
				disqualified.
			</p>
			<p>
				Also, we feel design-wise that icon is lacking -- it <em>reads</em>
				as "my body is the key" -- and that doesn't promote clarity and trust
				for non-technical folks.

		<details id="why-not-icon">
			<summary>Why not ___ for an icon?</summary>

			<p>
				There's already been quite a few ideas on icons for this purpose.
				We're grateful for all ideas, but not all ideas are suitable for
				the goals here.
			</p>
			<p>
				Why not an icon with only a fingerprint? Because <strong>a
				lot</strong> of users have newer iOS devices that only use Face
				ID, and many have never used their fingerprint to unlock their
				device! Similarly, many Windows users have only ever used
				Windows Hello (Face ID). But millions of Android users have
				only ever unlocked their devices with their fingerprint (Touch ID).
			</p>
			<p>
				The point? We need an icon that doesn't assume fingerprint or face.
				FIDO skips both in their icon, but... we think we can do better.
			</p>
			<p>
				Also, many <em>clever</em> ideas, such as an oval with one half side
				as a fingerprint and the other half side as a face, seem really good
				conceptually, but in execution do not have any legibility or
				recognizability when the icon is rendered small (under 30px square).
			</p>
			<p>
				Icon design is a really tricky skill & art. It's even harder than
				logo design!
			</p>
			<p>
				If you have ideas that you think will execute better on the goals
				and vision here, please let us know! Try out your icon by
				<a href="/">uploading in the garden</a> on this site, and send us
				screenshots of what it looks like. Your icon might just be chosen
				by the community as the preferred standard!
